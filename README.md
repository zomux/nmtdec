# nmtdec
A framework for high-performance decoding algorithms for Neural Machine Translation.

We want to make it be indenpendent from a deep learning framework, so one can use it will any model.

Things to do:
- Single-Queue Decoding (https://arxiv.org/abs/1707.01830)
- Auto hyperparameter tuning with Bayesian Optimization
- MBR-based decoding given evidences
- REINFORCE-based score enhancement (continous actions)
- Actor-Critic based score enhancement

This repository will be updated soon after code refactoring.
